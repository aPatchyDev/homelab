## IncusOS

IncusOS was selected for the following reason:
- Official terraform provider
- Automatically managed host OS
	- Immutable
- Built on minimal debian
	- Hope for lower overhead

IncusOS was abandoned for the following reasons:
- Restricted host network configuration
	- Could not figure out how to configure host as a network switch
